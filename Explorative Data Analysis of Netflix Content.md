In the distribution for rating, the top three are TV-14, TV-MA, and TV-PG. They are programs including materials that defined not suitable for children under 17, 14, or younger. The emphasis shows that Netflix has still put its main market on the adult content.

2. For further understanding, what about looking at ratings under the context of TV Show vs. Movie?

Netflix has three quarter of content concentrated on movie, while the rest of 24.2% belongs to TV show. Therefore, Netflix has much more focus on movies than shows.

By comparing rating type frequency with content type (movie vs. tv show) we see there is a similar trend still that Netflix puts more emphasis on adult content for their audience. However, there is a consistent choice where Netflix has put more effort in bringing movies in the platform. The only two exceptions here are for TV-Y7 and TV-Y7-FV. They are both programs for children age 7 and above. This could be Netflix aiming for a children's market that contains more TV shows for child education.

3. Which countries have the most productions?
